# Youtube-Clone
A responsive YouTube homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. This project replicates the design and structure of YouTube's homepage with clickable video links for basic navigation. It serves as a front-end practice to improve my skills in web design, layout, and responsive development, but does not include advanced user interaction features such as login or video playback.
